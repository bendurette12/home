		<h1>POMB</h1>

		<ul>
			<li>There is no ultimate meaning/purpose in life (at least that we can be aware of)</li><br>
		
			<li>Yet, I choose to live any way, and if I'm going to live, I may as well do it well</li><br>
		
			<li>Change is the only constant. It should be embraced, rather than feared.</li><br>
		
			<li>Growth comes through discomfort</li><br>
		
			<li>I need goals and to be challenged, both big and small</li><br>

			<li>Deep, meaningful relationships are possibly the most important and life giving parts of my life</li><br>

			<li>A healthy social life (friends, community, activities, etc...) is important as well</li><br>

			<li>Consistent exercise and meditation are mandatory</li><br>

			<li>Always keep an open mind, but critique everything before accepting anything</li><br>

			<li>Discipline and order are more fulfilling than disorder, but also allow room for laziness and spontaneity</li><br>

			<li>Learning is possibly the second most important and life giving part of my life</li><br>

			<li>Always read</li><br>

			<li>There is rarely a reason to actually be mad at someone. Rather, understand their opinions/actions by looking at life from their perspective (shoutout to Marcus Aurelius)</li><br>
		
			<li>Accept your faults and be compassionate to yourself while constantly working to improve</li><br>

			<li>Life is limited, choose what to prioritize without much regret</li><br>

			<li>You think a lot, bro. Give yourself space to process and think, but know when to cut yourself off before getting too bogged down</li><br>

			<li>Life can be lonely, surround yourself with people who love you, challenge you, and let you feel (mostly) understood</li>
		</ul>
